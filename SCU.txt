Santa Clara University (also referred to as Santa Clara) is a private Jesuit university located in Santa Clara, California. It has 5,435 full-time undergraduate students, and 3,335 graduate students. Founded in 1851, Santa Clara University is the oldest operating institution of higher learning in California,[5] and has remained in its original location for 166 years. The university's campus surrounds the historic Mission Santa Clara de Asis, which traces its founding to 1776. The campus mirrors the Mission's architectural style, and provides a fine early example of Mission Revival Architecture.

The university offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees through its six colleges, the School of Arts and Sciences, School of Education and Counseling Psychology, Leavey School of Business, School of Engineering, Jesuit School of Theology, and School of Law. Santa Clara has produced four Rhodes Scholars[6][7] and has been recognized as a top producer of Fulbright Scholars.[8][9]

Among Santa Clara's alumni are governors, congressmen, mayors, senators, and presidential cabinet members. Santa Clara alumni founded Nvidia and Farmer's Insurance, and created JavaScript. Santa Clara's alumni have won a number of honors, including Pulitzer Prizes, the NBA MVP Award, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Santa Clara alumni have served as mayors of San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, San Jose, and Washington, DC. Both the current Governor and Lieutenant Governor of California attended Santa Clara.

Santa Clara's sports teams are called the Broncos. Their colors are red and white. The Broncos compete at the NCAA Division I levels as members of the West Coast Conference in 19 sports. Broncos have won NCAA championships in both men's and women's soccer. Santa Clara's student athletes include current or former 54 MLB, 24 NFL, and 12 NBA players and 14 Olympic won gold medalists.
The university is situated in Santa Clara, California, adjacent to the city of San Jose in Santa Clara County at the southern part of the Bay Area. It is commonly known by the abbreviation SCU; its students and 81,000 alumni, which live in all fifty states and around the world, are called "Santa Clarans" or "Broncos," and its athletic teams are called the Broncos. The school is promoted as "the Jesuit university in Silicon Valley."[10]

Built around historic Mission Santa Clara, the present university is home to a population of approximately 5,435 undergraduate and 3,335 master's, Juris Doctor, and PhD students.[3] The institution employs 522 full-time faculty members, who are divided between four professional schools and the College of Arts and Sciences, all of which are located on the 106-acre (43 ha) mission campus.[11] In July 2009 the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley (JST), formerly an independent institution, legally merged with the university, taking the name "Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University." Although a division of SCU, it retains its campus in Berkeley, California. JST is one of two Jesuit seminaries in the United States with ecclesiastical faculties approved by the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education.[12] The other, Weston Jesuit School of Theology, completed a similar affiliation with Boston College in June 2008, becoming Boston College School of Theology and Ministry.[13]

For the 2013ñ2014 academic year, the university's operating budget was $387 million, and its endowment was $760 million.[14] For the same period, undergraduate tuition and fees totaled $42,156 and the average cost of room and board was $12,546.[15]

Santa Clara University is civilly chartered and governed by a board of trustees, which appoints the president. By internal statute, the president must be a member of the Jesuit order, although the members of the board are primarily non-Jesuits.[16] About 42 Jesuit priests and brothers are active teachers and administrators in various departments and centers located on the main campus in Santa Clara. An additional 15 Jesuits currently hold faculty positions at the university's Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley.[11] Jesuits comprise around 7% of the permanent faculty and hold teaching positions in biology, computer engineering, counseling psychology, economics, English, history, law, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, religious studies, and theater arts in addition to theology. They also serve in campus and residence-hall ministry, and some act as faculty directors in residential learning communities (RLC's).

SCU maintains its Catholic and Jesuit affiliation and supports numerous initiatives intended to further its religious mission. Students are encouraged, but not required, to attend the Sunday evening student Masses in the mission church and are also encouraged to participate in campus ministry programs and lectures. All bachelor's degrees require three religious studies courses as part of the academic core. An emphasis on social justice is furthered through the Pedro Arrupe Partnership and Kolvenbach Solidarity programs, which offer service opportunities in the community and immersion opportunities throughout the world.[17]

The first two colleges in California were founded at the height of the Gold Rush in 1851, both in the small agricultural town of Santa Clara. Less than a year after California was granted statehood, Santa Clara College, forerunner of Santa Clara University, was the first to open its doors to students and thus is considered the stateís oldest operating institution of higher education. Shortly after Santa Clara began instruction, the Methodist-run California Wesleyan College received a charter from the State Superior Court on July 10, 1851óthe first granted in Californiaóand it began enrolling students in May of the following year.[18] Santa Claraís Jesuit founders lacked the $20,000 endowment required for a charter, which was eventually accumulated and a charter granted on April 28, 1855.[19] Santa Clara bears the distinction of awarding Californiaís first bachelor's degree, bestowed upon Thomas I. Bergin in 1857, as well as its first graduate degree granted two years later.
Santa Clara University is a private corporation owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees composed of 44 members.

The University's administration consists of a president, a provost, an executive assistant to the president, a University General Counsel, vice presidents for the University's various departments, as well as vice provosts, assistant vice presidents, associate vice presidents, Executive Directors, Directors, Deans, a Chief Investment Officer, a University Registrar, a University Librarian, and an Athletic Director. The current president is Michael Engh, S.J., who became president January 2009.

Santa Clara University is organized into six professional schools, the School of Arts and Sciences, School of Education and Counseling Psychology, SCU Leavey School of Business, School of Engineering, Jesuit School of Theology, and the School of Law. The University's professional schools are all led by an academic dean.
The School of Engineering was founded and began offering bachelor's degrees in 1912. Over the next century, the school added Master's and doctoral programs designed to meet Silicon Valley's growing need for expert engineers. Today, the Valley provides opportunities for the school's students and faculty, particularly those in electrical engineering and information technology, to work closely with high-tech companies and government institutions. This ranges from individual internships to larger partnerships with projects such as O/OREOS.
As of Fall 2012, Santa Clara had an enrollment of 5,250 undergraduate and 3,269 graduate and professional students (total of 8,519 students).[3] Men make up 52.3% of the total student population; women 47.7%.[3]

Santa Clara offers undergraduates the opportunity to pursue 45 majors in its three undergraduate schools and colleges: the College of Arts and Science, the School of Engineering, and the Leavey School of Business. Santa Clara University also has six graduate and professional schools, including the School of Law, School of Engineering, the Leavey School of Business, the School of Education and Counseling Psychology, and the Jesuit School of Theology (campus located in Berkeley, California).

The student to faculty ratio is 12:1 with 71% of all classes being fewer than 30 students.[3]

The 2013 annual ranking of U.S. News & World Report categorizes it as 'more selective'. For the Class of 2018 (enrolled fall 2014), Santa Clara received 14,985 applications and accepted 7,395 (49.3%). Of those accepted, 1,328 enrolled,[3] a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 17.4%. SCU's freshman retention rate is 95%, with 86% going on to graduate within six years.[3]

The enrolled first-year class of 2018 had the following standardized test scores: the middle 50% range (25th percentile-75th percentile) of SAT scores was 590-680 for SAT Critical Reading and 620-700 for SAT Math, while the middle 50% range of ACT scores was 27-32. The average grade point average (GPA) was 3.67 (unweighted 4 point scale).

For SCU's 2011ñ2012 school year, undergraduate tuition and fees were $37,368, room and board cost $11,742, and books estimated at $5,000, totaling $54,110.[31]
